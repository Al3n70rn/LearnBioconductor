Description: This course is directed at beginning and intermediate
    students who would like an introduction to the analysis and
    comprehension of high-throughput sequence data using R and
    Bioconductor. Day 1 focuses on learning essential background: an
    introduction to the R programming language; central concepts for
    effective use of Bioconductor software; and an overview of
    high-throughput sequence analysis work flows. Day 2 emphasizes use
    of Bioconductor for specific tasks: an RNA-seq differential
    expression work flow; exploratory, machine learning, and other
    statistical tasks; gene set enrichment; and annotation.  Day 3
    transitions to understanding effective approaches for managing
    larger challenges: strategies for working with large data, writing
    re-usable functions, developing reproducible reports and work
    flows, and visualizing results. The course combines lectures with
    extensive hands-on practicals; students are required to bring a
    laptop with wireless internet access and a modern version of the
    Chrome or Safari web browser.
